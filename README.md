# Turtle Script!

Hey thanks for checking out my repository. I am building a statically typed JIT compiled language in Python using LLVM. The language is most similar looking to typescript.

## Help Needed
If you are reading this I need help making my code more readable. Please edit the docstrings to funtions and classes to make it more readable. I also need help with this readme. I plan to give a talk to the SBCC CS Club on November 22nd. All pull requests are welcome.
